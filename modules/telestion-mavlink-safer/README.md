### Getting Started

Have a look at the `Main` file in the package `org.telestion.safer.mavlink`. 
This file starts the HelloWorld verticle from the `telestion-core` module. 
You could create your own verticle like the given one in the mavlink package to implement your feature.
Then it has to be enabled in the main class.
