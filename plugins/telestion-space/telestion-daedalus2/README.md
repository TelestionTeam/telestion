# Telestion Daedalus2 Plugin
Contains the implementation of Daedalus 2 for Telestion.
This repository needs the `telestion-api` libraries to work.
Execute `telestion-api:publishApi`to copy the needed libraries.
This works only if you develop this plugin as a submodule of the main application.
Otherwise, you have to get them by a contract if this project is developed externally.
You might have to reload your project afterwards.
